<p>The following table describes important VxFlex Manager terms and concepts.<table class="table frame-all" id="TABLE_C595316169014E67A031D08624AB141F"><thead><tr><td>Term</td><td>Definition</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resource</td><td>In VxFlex Manager, resources are the physical and virtual elements 



in VxRack FLEX such as network switches, nodes, virtual
machine managers (VMware vCenter), and element managers (OpenManage Enterprise). VxFlex Manager
maintains an inventory of the various attributes and components of
these resources. It uses this inventory for configuration
operations. 
</td></tr><tr><td>Template</td><td>VxFlex Manager uses templates to capture the requirements of IT services
deployed in the datacenter. An administrator defines requirements
once in a template and it is then used to automate configuration of
resources. Using a template in an automated process ensures
consistency and repeatability. Templates are not instantiated until
a deployment of resources is requested.
<p>Templates let you supply unique IT business service end-state
requirements to be used in pre-defined automation workflows. A
template contains all resources for its supporting service(s). You
build a template by selecting the necessary components and
specifying the appropriate quantity and configuration for each
resource.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>Service</td><td>A
service deployment is the process of automating the configuration
of physical and virtual resources.
When you require a new IT service, an administrator selects an
appropriate template and triggers an automated deployment. <p>A service contains specific resources, which VxFlex Manager selects and
configures according the requirements defined in the template.
Overall system health is determined using the deployment status,
compliance, and health of components in a service. VxFlex Manager determines
a component&#39;s deployment status by comparing its automated
deployment to the template requirements for that resource.
</p><p>For IT administrators, lifecycle management of a service includes
compliance, capacity, and decommissioning operations. The service,
not the template, is the representation of the instantiated IT
service. If an IT service requires a change in capacity, the
service can be used to add or remove resources.
</p><p>You can remove a service that is no longer required. VxFlex Manager supports two types of removal. You can delete the entire service, which deletes the deployment information and also makes any required configuration changes for components associated with the service. Alternatively, you can remove just the deployment information for the service without making any configuration changes to the deployed components.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>RCM compliance</td><td>VxFlex Manager monitors current firmware and software levels  and compares
them to the RCM, which contains the baseline firmware and software
versions. VxFlex Manager shows any deviation from the baseline in the
compliance status of the resources. You can use VxFlex Manager to initiate
updates to bring the resources to a compliant state.
</td></tr><tr><td>Repository</td><td>As part of RCM compliance, the RCM packages must be collected to a
location from which updates can be performed. You can create more
than one repository, selecting one for the default. This default
repository is used to calculate compliance for all undeployed
resources. VxFlex Manager lets you specify other repositories for deployed
resources.
<p>The operating system is included with the RCM, and you can select the operating system you want to use from the RCM. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>
