<p>Active System Manager (ASM) is Dell’s unified management
product that provides a comprehensive infrastructure and workload
automation solution for IT administrators and teams. ASM simplifies
and automates the management of heterogeneous environments enabling
IT to respond more rapidly to dynamic business needs.</p>
<p>IT organizations today are often burdened by complex
data centers that contain a mix of technologies from different vendors
and cumbersome operational tasks for delivering services while managing
the underlying infrastructure. These tasks are typically performed
through multiple management consoles for different physical and virtual
resources, which can dramatically slow down service deployment. </p>
<p>ASM features a user interface that provides an intuitive,
end-to-end infrastructure and workload automation experience through
a unified console. This speeds up workload delivery and streamlines
infrastructure management, enabling IT organizations to accelerate
service delivery and time to value for customers.</p>
