When this option is selected, the deployment  installs the MDM, SDS, and SDC components, as required for a VxFlex OS deployment in a VMware environment. The MDM and SDS components are installed on a dedicated VxFlex OS VM (SVM), and the SDC is installed directly on the ESXi host.</p><p>To deploy a VxFlex OS cluster successfully, include at least three nodes in the template. The deployment process adds an SVM for each hyper-converged node. VxFlex Manager uses the following logic to determine the MDM roles for the nodes: </p><ol id="OL_C37900EA926345058600724E5B10BBE0"><li id="LI_F0AC60216D97425591A65731A8E67CB7">Checks the VxFlex OS Gateway inventory to see how many primary MDMs, secondary MDMs, and tie breakers are currently present, as well as the total numbers of SDS components.</li><li id="LI_C34657A68411426A81466C9818D96633">Adds the number of components being deployed to determine the overall VxFlex OS cluster size.

This makes the devices available for direct access by the virtual machines on the host and also sets up the devices to run in PCI passthrough mode.</p><p>For each SDS in the cluster, the deployment adds all of the available disks from the nodes to the storage pools created.</p><p>For each compute only or hyper-converged node, the deployment installs the SDC VIB.</p><p>VxFlex Manager supports VxFlex OS cluster deployments on ESXi 6.0 and 6.5 nodes. </p><p>When you select this option, the teaming and failover policy for the cluster are  automatically set to <span class="uicontrol">Route based on IP hash</span>. In addition, the uplinks are configured as active and active,  instead of active and standby. Teaming is configured for all port groups, except for the VxFlex OS Data 1 and VxFlex OS Data 2 port groups.  </p><p>If you select the option to <span class="uicontrol">Use Node For Dell EMC VxFlex OS</span>, the <span class="uicontrol">Local Flash storage for Dell EMC VxFlex OS</span> option is automatically selected as the <span class="uicontrol">Target Boot Device</span> under <span class="uicontrol">Hardware Settings</span>.</p>

If you add a compute only node, only the SDC is added. If you add a hyper-converged node, both the SDC and SDS are added.</p><p>If you select a RHEL image type in the <span class="uicontrol">OS Image</span> field, the <span class="uicontrol">VxFlex OS Role</span> must be set to <span class="uicontrol">Storage Only</span>. If you add a storage only node, only the SDS is added. The only prerequisites for a storage only node are that the iDRAC must have an IP address and a credential. VxFlex Manager takes care of all other configuration steps required for the node. For each node, VxFlex Manager configures the MDM roles as needed and configures the SDS RPMs. Once the cluster has been set up, VxFlex Manager adds every node as an SDS. Then, it adds all available disks for the SDS device, adds a storage pool, and adds all disks to the storage pool.</p><p>If you are creating  a compute only or hyper-converged template, be sure to include both the <span class="uicontrol">VMWare Cluster</span> and <span class="uicontrol">VxFlex OS Cluster</span> components in the template builder. If  you are creating a storage only template, do not include a <span class="uicontrol">VMWare Cluster</span> component in the template builder.

For vMotion and hypervisor network, VxFlex Manager tags these networks on the switch node-facing ports for the entered information. For rack node, VxFlex Manager configures the vLANs on TOR node facing ports (untag PXE vLANs, and tag other vLANs).</p><p>If you select <span class="uicontrol">Import Configuration from Reference Node</span>, VxFlex Manager imports basic settings, BIOS settings, and advanced RAID configurations from the reference node and allows you to edit the configuration. Some BIOS settings might no longer apply once new BIOS settings are applied. VxFlex Manager does not correct these setting dependencies. When setting advanced BIOS settings, use caution and verify that BIOS settings on the hardware are applicable when not choosing Not Applicable as an option. For example, when disabling SD card, the settings for Internal SD card redundancy become not applicable.</p><p>You can edit any of the settings visible in the template, but keep in mind that many settings are hidden when using this option. For example, only ten out of many BIOS settings that you can see and edit using template appear. However, you can configure all BIOS settings. If you want to edit any of the settings that are not visible through the  template feature, edit them before importing or uploading the file.</p><p>Validate settings shows which potential nodes in inventory are compatible with the component configuration in the template.</p></div>
