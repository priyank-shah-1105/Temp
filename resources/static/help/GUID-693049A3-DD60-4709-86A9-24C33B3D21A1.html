<p>If you already have a cluster deployed that includes Dell-based hardware, you can discover and import these hardware resources and pull them in as an existing service. After adding the service, you can take advantage of the health monitoring, RCM compliance, and update features provided with VxFlex Manager, even though these resources were not originally deployed with VxFlex Manager.</p><p>Most actions that can be performed within VxFlex Manager for a new service can also be performed on an existing service. For example, you can:</p><ul id="UL_964A600A84FD4C35A69C313DCC982E56"><li id="LI_F2F6FACCEC4748BFAD3E02FF79CCF223">Update the inventory to incorporate changes made externally, as long as these changes are not destructive.</li><li id="LI_90530C29D5674974ADA7E51FB09CA4DD">Scale up the service by adding new nodes, networks, or volumes. </li><li id="LI_1B0046FFA14E4C28A6A2BE16A48554A0">Scale down the service by removing nodes.</li><li id="LI_CB9A5E7657AC44FEA9E65D9BAFEDECBC">Remove the service without tearing down the deployment,</li><li id="LI_2EC2915746DC42F1978522AEA4DCA6AB">Remove the service and also tear down the deployment.</li><li id="LI_2D0682AA48644012B58754ABCD0D808C">Perform software and firmware updates.</li></ul><p>The following limitations apply to existing services:</p><ul id="UL_2F08544CA38D4288BBCBD78315346760"><li id="LI_BDC75FE46815455D934BE203C8AF6011">Existing services can be created for hyper-converged and compute only nodes. Storage only nodes cannot be added to an existing service.</li><li id="LI_E94450B1F27C435C81B65DD7E346B335">No destructive changes should be made outside VxFlex Manager, or the update inventory function will not be successful. The workaround for this limitation is to remove and rediscover the service.</li><li id="LI_5E544D40946B4EFAB0C923FBF2E015BC">You cannot update or restore a service from an earlier version of VxFlex Manager, due to network changes. The workaround for this limitation is to remove and rediscover the service.</li><li id="LI_92C2DB82E1EF4B46BD856C9448AF2932">You can discover a service without switches.  However, actions performed within VxFlex Manager that require switch connectivity (for example, scaling up a node) will fail. Switches that are discovered, but are not allowed to be managed by VxFlex Manager should perform identically to newly  deployed services. In other words,  they are allowed and will succeed only if the switches are manually configured correctly.</li></ul>
<div class="note caution" id="GUID-03414F27-EBDE-4DCE-96D4-D06936AD3404"><span class="notelabel">CAUTION: </span>Deleting a component from the service also deletes the component
from the data center environment.</div>
<p> Before adding the service, you must have your vCenter, VxFlex OS  Gateway, and node hosts already discovered in the resource list. Only <b>Managed</b> or <b>Reserved</b> resources are included in the VxFlex OS service. If you have discovered a resource as <b>Unmanaged</b>, this component will be missing from the service. If you missed a component initially, you can change your resource inventory, and update the service to reflect these changes.</p><p>Each node is identified as a VxFlex OS host if the inventory for the node shows that it is present in a gateway, and it is properly configured as an SDC and SDS node. A VxFlex OS host will have the <span class="uicontrol">Use Node for Dell EMC VxFlex OS</span> check box set to <span class="uicontrol">True</span> in the OS settings for the node within the service deployment settings. </p><p>The VxFlex OS  Gateway must be included in the service, as VxFlex Manager needs to put the gateway in maintenance mode when it does a firmware update on the VxFlex OS cluster.</p>
